It addresses specific issues such as poor navigation bar spacing, overlapping header text, and inefficient use of space for court listings, also lacking a search function and visual clarity. The updated web app introduces fixes for these problems, including a restructured navigation bar, a search bar, multi-column card layout for courts, and distinct images and styling for each card.',
